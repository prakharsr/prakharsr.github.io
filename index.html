<p>Dear Recruiter, </p>
<br>
<p>
    I am currently in my final year at IIITM Gwalior, completing my B.Tech + M.Tech integrated
    course in Information Technology. I have a wide range of experience ranging from full stack
    development, hybrid development, blockchain development, familiarity with Linux and
    basic kernel development.
    <br>
    I interned with Sheru from June to September 2020 as a Django Developer. It involved the
    development of an admin dashboard for analyzing the business architecture from the
    perspective of the supply and demand. I was involved in finding ways in which the business
    of a ride sharing application can be boosted, exploring the architecture of real time location
    analyzing module, geospatial analysis of riders and drivers, managing business of supply
    side (drivers), managing business of demand side (riders) and how to make the most out of
    the existing data we have by segmentation methods and then acting upon them by creating
    campaigns, increasing customer reach by making a custom news poster to companyâ€™s
    Facebook Page. I am well versed with Django, Javascript, Python and MongoDB.
    <br>
    I also have prior experience with Angular development alongwith its integration with Ionic
    Framework to build hybrid applications. For my B.Tech Project, I developed a time series
    prediction tool using fuzzy logic and fuzzy information retrieval system to predict the trends
    in stock markets using Python, using metrics such as RSI, common candlestick patterns,
    NIFTY50/ BSI OHLC data.
    <br>
    I also have experience with Blockchains, decentralised application development and
    currently am doing research in my M.Tech Project which explores the integration of IoT and
    Blockchain to propose an architecture which overcomes the existing issues with IoT sector
    involving poor device integrity, security and data privacy using Hyperledger Aries. I also am
    well versed with other Blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and am very interested in the
    decentralsied finance (De-Fi) sector.
    <br>
    I would be grateful if I could join your team so that I can contribute to the health
    sector alongwith some possible integration of blockchain technology and hope to gain
    experience with the company.
</p>
